                    <br>
                    <p><strong>In short: </strong><i>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.<br><br><strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></i></strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your personal information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. </li>
                        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>
                        <ul>    
                            <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>
                            <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users.</li>
                            <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities.</li>
                            <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vital Interests</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong><u><i>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</i></u></strong><br><br>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.<br><br>In some exceptional vases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
                        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                        <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
                        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                        <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
